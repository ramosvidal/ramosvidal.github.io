I am a predoctoral researcher at the University of A Coruña, focusing on the evolution and maintainability of variability-intensive legacy systems. My work bridges software product lines and data-intensive systems, addressing the co-evolution of code, data schemas, and data.

During my research stay at North Carolina State University (US), I developed SPL-DB-Sync and the DAMI-Framework, contributing to the evolution and migration of legacy systems. I also coordinate R&D projects and teach courses on Databases, Business Process Modeling and Automation.

My academic background includes a Master’s degree in Data Science from the Polytechnic University of Madrid, where my final project received an award, and a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering from the University of A Coruña.

Always open to collaborations in software engineering, data science, and web information systems. Let’s connect and explore new ideas!
