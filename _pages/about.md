I am a postdoctoral researcher at the University of A Coruña, focusing on the evolution and maintainability of variability-intensive legacy systems. My work bridges software product lines and data-intensive systems, addressing the co-evolution of code, data schemas, and data.

During my research stay at North Carolina State University (US), I developed SPL-DB-Sync and the DAMI-Framework, contributing to the evolution and migration of legacy systems. I also coordinate R&D projects and teach courses on Databases, Business Process Modeling and Automation.

My academic background includes a Master’s degree in Data Science from the Polytechnic University of Madrid, where my final project received an award, and a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering from the University of A Coruña.

Always open to collaborations in software engineering, data science, and web information systems. Let’s connect and explore new ideas!

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
